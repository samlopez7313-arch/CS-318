        <h2>Berserk Manga</h2>
        <p>Berserk is a dark fantasy manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. It follows the story of Guts, a lone mercenary with a tragic past, as he battles against demonic forces and seeks revenge against his former friend Griffith. This is considered the "original" story, which was sadly left unfinished after the author's passing in 2023. Thankfully, the story is being finished by a close friend of his to honor the original story created.</p>
