        <h2>Berserk Anime 2016</h2>
        <p>The 2016 adaptation of Berserk tells, at least thus far, most of the full story from the Manga. Going past the Golden Age arc and into the Conviction arc, this adaptation uses 3D animation to bring the dark and gritty world of Berserk to life. While the animation style has been a point of contention among fans, the series continues to follow Guts' relentless quest for vengeance against Griffith and the demonic forces that plague his world.</p>
